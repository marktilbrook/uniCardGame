# Data Structures and Algorithms

Demonstration of java sorting algorithms and data structures.
This code was initially very slow. We were tasked to optimize the code through the use of sorting algorithms and changing data structures. This used a profiler to help find where the code was slow.

This repo is purely to show the code that I wrote.
